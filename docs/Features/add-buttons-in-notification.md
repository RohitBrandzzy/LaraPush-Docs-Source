Using buttons in notifications can enhance user engagement and provide more options for user interaction. Here are a few use cases:

**Read More:** This button can direct readers straight to a new blog post or an important article. It's a straightforward way to increase traffic and engagement on your latest content.

**Share:** A 'Share' button can encourage readers to share your blog post on their social media platforms, increasing your content's reach.

**Subscribe:** If your blog has a subscription service, a 'Subscribe' button in your notification can be an effective way to increase your subscriber count.

**Download:** If you offer downloadable content, like an e-book or a podcast, a 'Download' button can lead readers directly to the download link.
