# Adding and Integrating Multiple domains

To simplify the domain integration process, Larapush offers a convenient "Clone" feature. Follow these steps:

1. After successfully integrating your first domain, navigate to the Larapush Panel.
2. Locate the "Clone" option and click on it.
3. Enter the new domain name you wish to integrate.
4. Save the settings to proceed.
5. By cloning the domain, you can utilize the same Firebase project without going through the lengthy setup process each time.
6. Follow the same code integration process as before.


Once the code integration is done, your website is ready to engage your audience with push notifications.
