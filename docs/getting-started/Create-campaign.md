## How to Create New Campaign ##

1. **Creating New Camapaign**: To start, navigate to the 'Campaigns' tab and click on 'Create Campaign'. You can also do this directly from your dashboard.


2. **Launch URL** At this point, input the URL for the content you want to notify about. Click 'Fetch Content' to automatically gather the relevant information, like title and description, from the URL. This feature is a time-saver and ensures your notification matches the linked content.

However, If you want more control over the notification content, you can manually enter your launch URL. This lets you set the destination URL and manually input the notification title, message, and image URL, giving you more flexibility to customize the notification as needed.

4. **Preview and Send**: 
Preview your notification on the right side of the screen before sending. If you want a **live preview** before sending the notification, click on 'Live Preview' and allow the prompt. After checking, you can proceed to send your notification.
